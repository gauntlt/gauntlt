Feature: Evaluate received cookies against expected.

Background:
  Given "curl" is installed
  And the target hostname is "google.com"

Scenario: Verify server is returning the cookies expected
  When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    curl --include --location --head --silent <hostname>
    """
  Then the following cookies should be received:
    | name | secure | _rest              |
    | PREF | false  | {}                 |
    | NID  | false  | {'HttpOnly': None} |
