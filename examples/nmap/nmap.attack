Feature: nmap attacks for scanme.nmap.org and to use this for your tests, change the value in the profile
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name           | value        |
      | hostname       | scanme.nmap.org   |
      | host           | scanme.nmap.org   |
      | tcp_ping_ports | 22,25,80,443 |

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected set of ports using the nmap-fast attack step
    When I launch a "nmap-fast" attack
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      80/tcp   open
      """
  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected set of ports using the nmap fast flag
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      80/tcp   open
      """
  Scenario: Verify that there are no unexpected ports open
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should not contain:
      """
      22/tcp
      25/tcp
      """

  Scenario: Output to XML
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p 80,443 -oX foo.xml <hostname>
      """
    And the file "foo.xml" should contain XML:
      | css                                                          |
      | ports port[protocol="tcp"][portid="80"] state[state="open"]  |
      | ports port[protocol="tcp"][portid="443"] state[state="closed"] |
    And the file "foo.xml" should not contain XML:
      | css                                                          |
      | ports port[protocol="tcp"][portid="123"] state[state="open"] |
