Feature: Launch curl attack

Background:
  Given the following profile:
    | name     | value      |
    | target   | http://192.168.0.79:8080/bodgeit |
    | host     | localhost |
    | port     | 8090 |

Scenario: Verify no output is returned when running the scan
  When I launch an "owasp-zap" attack
  # check no output is returned
  Then the output should match /blah/ 
  #Then the stdout should not contain anything
